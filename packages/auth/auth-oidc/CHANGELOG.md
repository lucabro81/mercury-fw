# @mercury-fw/auth-oidc

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f631dd5: README: a link to the package's page on Mercury's documentation site (https://lucabro81.github.io/mercury-fw/), published from this release on. The HTTP channel's README points to the HTTP API reference there, and the core's memory section to the page that explains it.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d73e59: - `auth` in `mercury.config.ts` takes a list of providers as well as one: they're tried in order and the first that recognizes the caller decides who they are. One that fails to load, or fails on a request, is logged and the others still serve; a name taken twice is refused.
  - `createOidcAuth({ name })` is an OIDC provider of its own (`oidc-<name>`), configured by `OIDC_<NAME>_ISSUER` and `OIDC_<NAME>_AUDIENCE`, so an instance can accept several issuers. `oidcAuth` is unchanged.
  - A principal's provider can be `oidc-<name>`; each provider's people keep their own keys.
  - `zitadelDirectory` takes `ZITADEL_AUTH_PROVIDER`, the auth provider whose subjects are its users (default `oidc`).

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 70a4900: - Needs the `@mercury-fw/*` framework packages at 0.45.0 or later: the earlier floor let an app install versions missing what this package imports.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d3e5af: Authentication for the HTTP surface.

  - An app declares an auth provider as `auth` in `mercury.config.ts`. The core builds it and hands channels `ctx.authenticate`. A provider that fails to load leaves the channel without it, so the surface stays closed.
  - New contract in `@mercury-fw/channel-types`: `AuthPlugin`, `AUTH_API_VERSION` and `Authenticate`. `PrincipalProvider` gains `oidc` and `static`.
  - New package `@mercury-fw/auth-oidc` verifies an OpenID Connect bearer token against the issuer's keys and checks `iss`, `aud` and expiry. It reads `OIDC_ISSUER` and `OIDC_AUDIENCE`.
  - New package `@mercury-fw/auth-static` maps fixed test tokens from `AUTH_STATIC_TOKENS` to users, for test apps and e2e tests.
  - Breaking, `@mercury-fw/channel-http`: the channel doesn't start without an auth provider.
  - `@mercury-fw/channel-http`: every route except `GET /openapi.yaml` and the `OPTIONS` preflights needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and a missing or refused token gets `401` before anything runs.
  - Breaking, `@mercury-fw/channel-http`: a conversation belongs to whoever opened it. The session key is `<caller id>:<conversationId>`, so the same id from someone else is a conversation of their own. Existing HTTP conversations stay readable but can't be continued.
  - `@mercury-fw/channel-http`: a confirmation token is checked against the caller's own session, so it can't be confirmed from someone else's.
  - `@mercury-fw/channel-http`: authenticated callers get their own episodic memory and wiki area.
  - `@mercury-fw/channel-http`: the read routes (`/conversations`, `/conversation`, `/wiki/*`, `/memory/scroll`, `/tool-log`, `/confirmations`) need an authenticated caller, but still show every person's data. Scoping them per person comes next, so don't give the surface to people who shouldn't see each other's conversations yet. Confirmation tokens are never listed.
  - The HTTP `tool` event carries the name of the tool the model called. `TurnSink.onToolStart` gets it as an optional fourth argument.
  - `mfw create` pairs the HTTP channel with an auth provider: `--auth oidc|static`, which the wizard asks for once HTTP is chosen.
  - `mfw e2e` runs cases on the HTTP surface (`channel: "http"`) as one of the test's `users`, each a token the app accepts. A turn can name its own user, and it reports the response's status.
  - `mfw create --local-packages <folder>` makes an app on packed tarballs, as `mfw local-packages` does on an existing one. Versions come from the tarballs, so a package that isn't published yet works too.
