### Minor Changes

- 0739f77: A plugin acts as the person Mercury is talking to, who logs in to the service through Mercury.

  - Plugin contract version 4: a plugin declares `actsAs: "person" | "mercury"`, and one acting as the person contributes a `login`; its tools get the turn's `person` and `requireLogin` in their context.
  - A person is offered only the plugins acting as the person: their prompt fragments, skills and tools. A plugin acting as Mercury, or declaring nothing, is offered on the terminal only until people can be allowed to make Mercury act as itself; the startup log names it.
  - `createCliTool` adds `--user` with the person's id to every command, staged confirmations included, and when the CLI exits with code 3 (not logged in) returns their login instead. `createCliPersonLogin` builds a plugin's `login` on a CLI's two-step remote login. A failed `runCli` carries `exitCode`.
  - Channel contract version 4: channels get `logins` (`accept` a callback URL, `complete` a login) and `detectLoginRequired`.
  - The HTTP channel, with `HTTP_SURFACE_PUBLIC_URL` set, streams a `login` event with the link to open and takes the person back at `GET /login/callback`, public and protected by the single-use state.
  - `mercury.cliCredentials` can declare `userSetup`, run by `mfw credentials setup <plugin> --user-app`: the app people log in through, set up without logging anyone in.
  - plugin-jira and plugin-bitbucket act as the person, on CLIs 2.3.0: set up their people's app with `--user-app` and register `<HTTP_SURFACE_PUBLIC_URL>/login/callback` on it. Jira's skill now says `currentUser()` is the person.
  - plugin-atlassian-admin acts as Mercury, on CLI 0.2.0, whose `init` asks for the key without echoing it: until permissions exist it's available on the terminal only.
  - A third-party plugin needs `apiVersion: 4` to load, and `actsAs: "person"` with a `login` to be offered to people.
