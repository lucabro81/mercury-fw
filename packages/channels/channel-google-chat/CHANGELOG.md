# @mercury-fw/channel-google-chat

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a7f2f13: A user directory decides who people are and what they may make Mercury do.

  - An app can declare a `directory` in `mercury.config.ts`. Given whoever a channel says is talking, it returns the person with their roles. The person's key is `<directory name>:<id>`, so one person reached from several channels keeps one private area, one memory and one set of confirmations.
  - With a directory the instance is closed. Someone it doesn't know gets a refusal and nothing runs, unless `access.unknown` is `"allow"`; `access.unknownMessage` sets what they're told. A directory that can't be reached, or fails to load, refuses everyone but the terminal. Answers are cached for five minutes, so a revoked role stops counting within that time.
  - `mercury.act-as-self` (every plugin) or `mercury.act-as-self.<plugin>` (one) lets a person make Mercury act with its own identity.
    - A plugin acting as Mercury, such as atlassian-admin, is offered only to those people, and on the terminal.
    - A plugin acting as the person also gives them each tool a second time, as `<tool>AsMercury`.
    - Every call made as Mercury for someone is logged with who asked.
  - `access.plugins` restricts a plugin to some roles. Prompts, skills and the manifest follow what each person is offered.
  - New package `@mercury-fw/directory-static`: people, their identities on each channel and their roles, listed in `DIRECTORY_STATIC_PEOPLE`.
  - The channel contract is at version 5:
    - `ChannelRuntimeContext.admit` says whether the core talks to a caller;
    - the reads are per person and async, the manifest included;
    - `DirectoryPlugin` is the directory contract;
    - `Principal` no longer carries `roles`.
  - `channel-http` answers `403` to a caller the directory doesn't know and `503` when it can't be reached, on every route.
  - `auth-static` refuses `roles` in `AUTH_STATIC_TOKENS`: roles come from the directory.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0739f77: A plugin acts as the person Mercury is talking to, who logs in to the service through Mercury.

  - Plugin contract version 4: a plugin declares `actsAs: "person" | "mercury"`, and one acting as the person contributes a `login`; its tools get the turn's `person` and `requireLogin` in their context.
  - A person is offered only the plugins acting as the person: their prompt fragments, skills and tools. A plugin acting as Mercury, or declaring nothing, is offered on the terminal only until people can be allowed to make Mercury act as itself; the startup log names it.
  - `createCliTool` adds `--user` with the person's id to every command, staged confirmations included, and when the CLI exits with code 3 (not logged in) returns their login instead. `createCliPersonLogin` builds a plugin's `login` on a CLI's two-step remote login. A failed `runCli` carries `exitCode`.
  - Channel contract version 4: channels get `logins` (`accept` a callback URL, `complete` a login) and `detectLoginRequired`.
  - The HTTP channel, with `HTTP_SURFACE_PUBLIC_URL` set, streams a `login` event with the link to open and takes the person back at `GET /login/callback`, public and protected by the single-use state.
  - `mercury.cliCredentials` can declare `userSetup`, run by `mfw credentials setup <plugin> --user-app`: the app people log in through, set up without logging anyone in.
  - plugin-jira and plugin-bitbucket act as the person, on CLIs 2.3.0: set up their people's app with `--user-app` and register `<HTTP_SURFACE_PUBLIC_URL>/login/callback` on it. Jira's skill now says `currentUser()` is the person.
  - plugin-atlassian-admin acts as Mercury, on CLI 0.2.0, whose `init` asks for the key without echoing it: until permissions exist it's available on the terminal only.
  - A third-party plugin needs `apiVersion: 4` to load, and `actsAs: "person"` with a `login` to be offered to people.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 521db42: Isolation between the people an agent talks to.

  - The core keeps one identity per person, `<provider>:<id>`, so two providers issuing the same id are two people. Memory, the conversation archive, the tool log and pending confirmations are keyed on it.
  - The wiki has a common area (`curated/`) everyone reads and an area per person (`users/<key>/`), which the model sees as `personal/`. Listing, reading and grepping reach the common area and the caller's own area, nothing else.
  - Breaking: the model's `write_file` writes only under `personal/notes/`. The new `promote_note` tool copies one of the person's notes into `curated/`, and only once they confirm it with the token.
  - A confirmation can only be confirmed by whoever staged it, in the same session. Its note is written once, in the person's area: a staged note no longer stays "pending" after it's resolved, for ids such as Google Chat's `users/<n>`.
  - Breaking, `@mercury-fw/channel-types`: channel contract 3. `confirm` and `resolveConfirmation` take the caller's `Principal`, and so does every read getter except `manifest` and `health`. Channels written for contract 2 are refused.
  - `@mercury-fw/confirm-engine`: the store's `stage`, `take` and `pending` take the owner's key.
  - Breaking, `@mercury-fw/channel-http`: every read route returns only the caller's data. `/conversation?id=` takes one of the caller's `conversationId`s and `/conversations` lists them by `conversationId`. `/wiki/read` answers `404` outside what the caller can see, and `/memory/scroll` answers `400` for a collection that isn't kept per person.
  - `@mercury-fw/channel-google-chat`: on channel contract 3.
  - At startup, an instance's existing data moves to the new layout. Google Chat and terminal notes go into their areas, and Qdrant's ids go onto the new keys. Ids that don't say which provider they came from are left in place and logged.
  - `mfw vault read` refuses a path outside the vault.
  - The admin panel's wiki box edits the common area with the operator's tools (list, read, grep, `write_curated`), the same the nightly review uses.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8bed46b: - A turn carries a `Principal` (the person behind it and the provider that vouched for them) instead of the opaque `userId` and `wikiUserId`; the core derives every per-person id from it.
  - Episodic memory follows the principal, not the channel: a session is captured whenever a provider vouched for the person. Google Chat keeps the ids it had; the terminal and the HTTP channel (until it authenticates its callers) send a principal nobody vouched for, so they stay out of episodic memory as before.
  - The HTTP channel accepts a `conversationId` on `/turn` and `/confirm` only made of letters, digits, `-` and `_`, up to 128 characters once trimmed, and answers `400` otherwise: a client-chosen id can no longer reach another user's wiki notes, forge log lines or break the turn. An existing HTTP conversation whose id has other characters can still be read with `/conversation`, but not continued. `/conversation` keeps opening any session key `/conversations` lists, whatever channel it came from.
  - The model's wiki read tools refuse a per-user id that isn't one path segment, as writes already did.
  - `CHANNEL_API_VERSION` is 2: a channel written for version 1 is refused at load.
  - The first-party channels declare their channel api version as a literal, so an older channel can't claim a newer contract it doesn't implement.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 5e09c69: - README: a section on connecting a new app to a Chat app that already exists (finding the service account and the subscription, creating a key, `mfw google-chat set-key`).
  - README: how to list and delete the keys the old instances left behind, before the service account reaches its limit of 10.
  - README: `--project` on the `keys create` command of the setup.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ab52977: An app created with the Google Chat channel trusts `protobufjs` in `trustedDependencies`, so its install no longer reports that package's postinstall as blocked. The channel's README says to do the same when adding it by hand.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 51bd439: `mfw google-chat set-key <key-file> [--subscription <name>]` writes the Google Chat channel's service account key (and its subscription) into the app's env file, the key on one line the way the channel reads it and never printed. The channel's setup uses it in place of the hand-written `sed`/`printf` step.
- de8b1e7: The README walks through setting up the Chat app step by step (gcloud wherever it can, the two Cloud Console pages field by field) and creates the Pub/Sub subscription with no expiration. A new section covers a subscription Pub/Sub deleted after 31 idle days: how to recreate it and give the service account its role back.
