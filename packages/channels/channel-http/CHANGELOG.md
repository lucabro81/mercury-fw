# @mercury-fw/channel-http

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8bed46b: - A turn carries a `Principal` (the person behind it and the provider that vouched for them) instead of the opaque `userId` and `wikiUserId`; the core derives every per-person id from it.
  - Episodic memory follows the principal, not the channel: a session is captured whenever a provider vouched for the person. Google Chat keeps the ids it had; the terminal and the HTTP channel (until it authenticates its callers) send a principal nobody vouched for, so they stay out of episodic memory as before.
  - The HTTP channel accepts a `conversationId` on `/turn` and `/confirm` only made of letters, digits, `-` and `_`, up to 128 characters once trimmed, and answers `400` otherwise: a client-chosen id can no longer reach another user's wiki notes, forge log lines or break the turn. An existing HTTP conversation whose id has other characters can still be read with `/conversation`, but not continued. `/conversation` keeps opening any session key `/conversations` lists, whatever channel it came from.
  - The model's wiki read tools refuse a per-user id that isn't one path segment, as writes already did.
  - `CHANNEL_API_VERSION` is 2: a channel written for version 1 is refused at load.
  - The first-party channels declare their channel api version as a literal, so an older channel can't claim a newer contract it doesn't implement.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 7926aa2: - Wiki grep ignores case, for the agent, the nightly review, `mfw vault grep` and the HTTP `/wiki/grep` route.
  - The agent's `write_file` and the nightly review's `write_curated` take a path starting with `curated/`, as listing, reading and grepping give it, instead of writing under `curated/curated/`.
